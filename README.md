# 🛡️ SOC Home Lab: Cloud-Native Security Monitoring

## 🚀 Project Overview
A cloud-based Security Operations Center (SOC) built to simulate real-world attack and defense scenarios. This lab leverages **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to host a vulnerable "Victim" machine and a centralized SIEM (Wazuh) for threat detection, log aggregation, and incident response.

## 🟢 Project Status: Phase 1 (Infrastructure Provisioning)
**Current Focus:** Provisioning secure Cloud Infrastructure, configuring VPC networks, and establishing Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) access.
